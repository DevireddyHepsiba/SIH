## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s the Problem?

Most colleges and universities donâ€™t have a proper system to manage their alumni. Once students graduate, their contact info, career updates, and academic history often get lost or spread across different platforms like WhatsApp or outdated email lists.

This makes it hard to:

* Stay in touch with alumni
* Involve them in events or mentoring
* Raise funds
* Build a strong alumni network

Solving this problem can:

* Make alumni feel more connected to their institution
* Open doors for mentoring, internships, and networking
